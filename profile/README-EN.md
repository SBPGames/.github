## About us
SBP Games, <span title="Litszro’s word">instanciated*</span> by a team of small beautiful prawns, is **an independent game development studio** of narrative adventures, **partially open-source**.

Through deep stories and events sometimes inspired from reality, <span title="Xib' sentence">we try to bring the player to live an immersive experience, both visual and emotional*</span>. We're not simply content to offer you a seamless gameplay: we're also looking to <span title="Veritis' quote">affect you with a strong message*</span>, like an intense journey you'll never forget.

Above all, we give you access to our open-source design and development tools, such as our proudly created game engine (licensed under the [`GNU-LGPL`](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/) and [`CC-BY-SA`](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/)).

While one person remains in charge of coordinating the team and the studio, all members lead, work, learn, suggest, modify and <span title="Qalolaq’s word">have fun*</span> together, ensuring that everyone can contribute their talents and qualities to the group.
